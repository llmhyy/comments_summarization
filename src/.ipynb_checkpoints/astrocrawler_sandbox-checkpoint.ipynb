      "Below are the interpretations of the Sun in the zodiac signs. Or see instead \n",
      "Sun in Aries\n",
      "Aries sun natives can be inspirational, courageous, enthusiastic, original, independent, impatient, aggressive, headstrong, selfish, self-centered, and impulsive. The Aries person’s energies are directed toward building a new individuality, thus all the Aries’ energies are directed towards themselves and what they want. An Aries likes roles where their leadership abilities are put on display. Aries natives have executive and organizing ability which is mainly directed in starting things. Sustaining projects is not their strength, but initiating projects is. The tendency to \"damn the torpedoes\" and ram full-speed ahead must be controlled. Aries natives are capable of great accomplishments if they learn how to constructively use their abundant energies. Aries natives are naturally enthusiastic and are always ready for activity and competition. They are inspiring to others because of these tendencies. Ideas and creative projects seem to flow from them in a never-ending stream. They are full of energy and never lack courage.\n",
      "Because Aries natives can be pretty self-centered, they must remember that other people may have good ideas and can assume responsibility and leadership roles, too. The natural tendency for an Arian is to stand alone and do everything themselves. But cooperation with others can be very effective in getting things done to the end rather than simply starting things and quitting before completion. Aries natives have a tendency to start a project, then to suddenly lose interest in it if progress is too slow or things have become too complicated. \n",
      "Aries natives are very straight-forward and are neither subtle nor devious. They say what's on their mind and they pull no punches. They don't hold grudges and although they can get quite angry, they do not hold it in and stew about what bothers them. They blow in and out like some great Midwestern thunderstorm. It may be violent while it lasts, but it is usually over quickly.\n",
      "Aries natives are prone to headaches due to tension. Aries natives are usually aggressive in relationships and generally take the lead. They go after what interests them and the chase may be more fun for them than the conquest.\n",
      "Four things an Arian should learn are patience, conservation of energy, completion, and control of temper.\n",
      "None\n",
      "Sun in Taurus\n",
      "Taurus natives are generally strong, quiet, deliberate, practical, exacting, determined, persistent, persevering, compassionate and loyal. They like getting their hands on their work, building things, and seeing the tangible, practical results of their effort. Routine work does not bother them as long as the end result is useful and serves some concrete purpose.\n",
      "Possessions and material things are usually of great significance to Taurus natives. This is because they don't feel emotionally secure unless they can see and touch the objects they own. This intense need to possess and enjoy with the senses can drive Taurus natives to be extremely productive or extremely acquisitive. Lesser evolved Taurus natives can treat people as objects or possessions, thus leading to difficulty in relationships.\n",
      "Taurus people work at a slower pace than most, but they always finish whatever projects they start. Because of this, they are reliable, trustworthy, careful and steadfast. They are better at sustaining what others have started rather than starting things themselves. Taurus natives can be lead, but never pushed.\n",
      "It takes a lot to make a Taurus mad, yet if they are pushed over the edge, well, all heck can break lose. Simply imagine an angry bull and you know what a Taurus is capable of when he is pushed too far. You know the saying about a bull in a china shop, right? When angered, Taurus natives need plenty of time to cool down. It is best to just leave them alone. You will know when things are out of their system. With anything, Taurus natives need time to assimilate and mull things over. Don't rush them or push them.\n",
      "Taurus natives are slow to change their opinions, but once changed it is very difficult to change them back. People tend to feel secure around Taurus natives. In times of crisis, they are generally cool and collected and have the patience and ability to come up with practical solutions to problems. Taurus natives hate pain and being sick.\n",
      "Taurus natives have a love of harmony and beauty and they can be extremely affectionate and romantic. But, they do have a decided fear of loss. The feelings that usually accompany this fear of loss are possessiveness, jealousy, laziness, stubbornness and extravagance. If there is no desire to possess anything or anyone, then there is no fear of loss. Taurus natives need to learn to desire only mental and spiritual things and to release the desire to possess people emotionally and physically. Their other need is to find a true sense of values. They need to learn detachment. They must be willing to let go of people and things.\n",
      "None\n",
      "Sun in Gemini\n",
      "Gemini natives are friendly, clever, talkative, versatile, curious, perceptive, intuitive, and logical. At times, they can also be quite contradictory, restless, two-faced, critical, and impatient. Gemini people enjoy and need work that includes a great deal of variety. They love to do several things all at the same time, sometimes making them late for appointments. They abhor boredom. Gemini natives tend to flit from one experience to another, gathering in all types of information along the way, but seldom getting to the depth of any subject. They go broad and not deep. Persistence is not their strong suit. Gaining knowledge and disseminating it is their real talent. Hence, they make wonderful salespeople or teachers if they stick around long enough to get all the facts instead of only half the story. Even if they do not possess all the facts, since they are never at a loss for words, they will continue with their story as if they did have all the facts.\n",
      "It is important for a Gemini natives to seek intellectual satisfaction. Mental stagnation turns them off, so they read extensively and communicate widely in order to satisfy this longing for mental stimulation. This discontent can make them either very ambitious, or it can incline them to jump from one thing to another, searching for the greener grass which never appears. \n",
      "Gemini natives usually think quickly on their feet and have the ability to use the right words in any situation. They possess tremendous wit and a good sense of humor. Other people may have difficulty in keeping up with their rapid change of subjects.\n",
      "Because Gemini natives think so quickly, they often finish other people's sentences for them. This can be most frustrating for the person trying to express their own thoughts. There is a need to learn how to control the tongue and allow slower people to express their own opinions and ideas.\n",
      "Since Gemini natives have the capacity to see both sides of any issue, they may fluctuate back and forth between opposing viewpoints. They will usually tend to side with the opinion of whomever they happen to be with at the moment. Then they change as the circumstances change. Indecisiveness is a problem for Gemini natives.\n",
      "Gemini natives are usually emotionally detached. They use their minds rather than their hearts to find their way through things. Logic and reason are their guidelines. They are able to understand what makes other people behave as they do, but they have difficulty in projecting themselves into the emotional reactions of the person involved.\n",
      "Some of the negative traits that Gemini natives possess are lack of concentration and focus, undependability, fickleness, indecisiveness, superficiality, wishful thinking, and dreaminess. They can also be pretty good at nagging.\n",
      "Gemini natives need to work on getting their mind under control. Their nervous system is highly strung. If they don't learn to control their nerves, they are apt to become ill. The way out of this difficulty is to take the emphasis off themselves and lose it through service to others. Above all, the Gemini needs to learn to channel (control) their energy and mind.\n",
      "None\n",
      "Sun in Cancer\n",
      "Cancer natives have a strange way of moving through life in a sideways manner, never approaching life head-on, but always from the side. They generally do not tackle anything straight away, but always from the flank. Emotionally, they are up one minute and down the next. These mood swings are sometimes difficult for others to understand and deal with.\n",
      "Cancer natives are tenacious, sympathetic, industrious, sociable, thrifty, and protective. They can also be argumentative, sensitive, emotional, martyr-like, intuitive, psychic, and patriotic.\n",
      "Cancer natives respond to life through their emotions rather than through their minds. They tend to absorb the emotional vibrations of wherever they're at, so it is important to always be in positive environments. Because they live in their feelings, they unconsciously seek sympathy and attention and affection from others. They have a strong need to feel secure. Home and family bring the highest sense of security. Because of all this, they want to be first with those they love or they are very unhappy. Cancer natives must learn to release their loved ones to live their own lives.\n",
      "Cancer natives are well-known for changing – their minds, their moods, anything. Since they usually possess a slower moving life force, they are usually less active than others. In order to be active, they must first motivate their mind. In general, they dislike exercise. As a consequence, they may become out of shape and gain weight in later years.\n",
      "Cancer natives most often have excellent memories. This causes them to reminisce about the past and how things were done then. They are generally pack rats, saving everything, especially if it has some sentimental value. This gives a sense of security.\n",
      "Cancer natives are home loving, fond of family life and domestic tranquility, enjoyers of travel and adventure, quietly tenacious and hard working for the welfare of the family. No matter how far they may roam, they always want a home to come back to. They may not be in it very much, but they still want a secure home base.\n",
      "Cancer natives are conservative, but unfortunately, they are born worriers. Their tendency to keep all their problems to themselves is the reason some of them suffer from ulcers. They have this sense that something is about ready to sneak up on them and \"get\" them. Watch a Cancer walk and see if they aren't walking a bit sideways, looking ahead of them and behind them at the same time. Stabilizing the emotions is important work for any Cancer person.\n",
      "None\n",
      "Sun in Leo\n",
      "Leo natives are dignified, courageous, affectionate, powerful, generous, playful, optimistic, ambitious, loyal, and cheerful. On the negative side, though, they can be quite demanding, intolerant, domineering, lazy, closed-minded, and self-centered. They choose to do things that give them wide scope for creativity, organizing, and leadership. Although appearing strong on the outside, most Leos are inwardly sensitive and their feelings are easily hurt. When this occurs, they can turn on the object of their affection, when their pride is hurt.\n",
      "Leo natives have a decided flair for the dramatic and they enjoy telling stories, being the center of attention, having a good time, and running the show. Mean and cruel acts are generally beneath them, but they do not hesitate to use force when needed. No matter what their actions, they always have the belief that whatever they do is for the other person's benefit.\n",
      "If a Leo is angered, he immediately goes into his kingly role, \"mounting his throne\" and quickly putting the opposition or challenger in their proper place. Leos literally roar at people when they are angry. But once their tirade is over, they forgive and forget and never hold a grudge.\n",
      "At their best, Leos are affectionate, cheerful, optimistic people who can be counted on to bring sunshine into other people's lives. They are exceptionally generous. Money appears to slip through their fingers as if it were grains of sand. And, like the sand, they have no idea where it has gone.\n",
      "Leos usually have vitality and good health, with strong recuperative powers. When they are ill, they have a tendency to run high fevers. They are seldom depressed, but when they are, they are devastated. Fortunately, their resilient powers are excellent, so they are soon sunny and happy again, unless their heart has been broken. That is the one thing a Leo has difficulty in overcoming. This can actually lead to physical troubles with their own heart. \n",
      "Leos need to admire their marriage partner. If they don't, the marriage may not last very long. In the end, Leos need to feel appreciated.\n",
      "None\n",
      "Sun in Virgo\n",
      "Virgos desire purity and perfection in all they are and all they do. They are generally reserved, shy, analytical, discriminating, precise, industrious, systematic, considerate, punctual, and reliable. Virgos are hard workers who usually have a great deal of common sense and are practical, with a flair for detailed work. On the negative side, though, they can also be aloof, skeptical, picky, sarcastic, depressed, critical, pessimistic, whiny, and self-centered. Virgo natives are happy when they can work with a lot of details, usually of a technical or analytical nature, in and for the service of others. They do not have to be the boss as service is more important than leadership.\n",
      "Virgo natives have curious and inquiring minds, with keen analysis and excellent memories. They enjoy analyzing people, situations, and problems. They always want to know how, why, when and where. It is sometimes hard for a Virgo to relax because boredom is something they cannot stand. They want to be busy, either doing or learning. A Virgo can generally be depended upon to fulfill a promise. They have a flair for organization and enjoy setting up schedules. There is an inborn love of order and harmony. They are always subconsciously seeking perfection in whatever they attempt. Because they push themselves so hard to be perfect, they have a tendency to look for perfection in others. If they find it lacking, they can become pretty critical and faultfinding.\n",
      "Virgos have a tendency to worry. This is because they desire perfection and are always thinking about how something can be made better or how they can do something better, even, and especially, after the fact. This tension can affect their health, causing intestinal disorders. Virgos need to develop a positive outlook on life, as this has a direct affect on their health. If they become too anxious about life, they can become hypochondriacs. They are generally healthy and are always looking for new ways to take care of themselves, usually through better diet or through natural means of healing. Whether old or young, all Virgo natives need a quiet period each day in order to rest their active minds. In any case, many Virgos look much younger than their years.\n",
      "In love, a Virgo has difficulty expressing himself as passionately as he desires. Virgos are very self-sufficient, but they are also very happy when they have someone to love, someone to serve.\n",
      "None\n",
      "Sun in Libra\n",
      "Libra natives like to weigh the pros and cons of a situation before they come to any conclusion. If carried too far, they get to the point where they can't come up with any conclusion, thus they can be very indecisive. They tip the scales one way, then the other, hoping to find the proper balance. Libra natives have an innate sense of fairness, though, and can be diplomatic, cooperative, helpful, idealistic, sociable, dependent, insincere, lazy and self-indulgent. Libra natives are happiest when in partnership or in situations where they can adjust or work with human relationships. Pleasant surroundings are important to them.\n",
      "Because Libra natives enjoy people and human interaction so much, they have a difficult time being alone. Because of this, they need to share their life with someone. Unfortunately, they have a tendency to be \"in love with love\", because of their romantic and sentimental natures. Thus, they could rush into marriage without forethought and end up in a difficult relationship.\n",
      "Libra natives find it virtually impossible to remain emotionally stable if there is discord around them. This leads to their wanting peace at any price, which allows others to take advantage of them. They want to be liked by everyone, sometimes to their detriment. As mentioned, indecisiveness can be one of the hardest problems for Libras to overcome. If they wait too long to make a decision, they may miss many excellent opportunities. Since they have the ability to see both sides of an argument, they generally do not like to choose either one. Since they are able to see the entire issue, if they are asked for help, they can give sound, practical advice. But their attempt to be all things to all people can lead them into hot water. They have difficulty saying \"no\". The other problem Libras find difficult to deal with is the desire to put off work for as long as they can. This gives them a reputation for being lazy. They aren't lazy, of course, if the proper motivation is there. It is, many times, easy for others to sway a Libra's opinion. A stronger personality can easily dominate a gentler Libra, until the Libra becomes incapable of making a move without consulting the \"expert\". Libras need to learn to think for themselves and stand up for their own beliefs and principles. Libras are quite creative, highly mental, and very sociable. This mental agility is usually not seen by others because of the Libra's easygoing, friendly appearance. Many times this mental agility plays out with them using very subtle techniques to get what they want, which they usually do.\n",
      "None\n",
      "Sun in Scorpio\n",
      "Two animals are used to represent Scorpio, the eagle and the scorpion. The eagle is capable of reaching great heights because he has mastered his lower nature and overcome his passions and the temptations of the sensual sphere. The eagle has risen above the physical world because he has regenerated himself. The scorpion, however, represents those who have not regenerated their thoughts and actions and are still living degenerate lives. They use their cunning and strike when least expected. These are the ones who satisfy their passions regardless of consequences.\n",
      "Scorpios in general are ambitious, efficient, courageous, resourceful and intuitive. But, they can also be jealous, sarcastic, resentful, stubborn, possessive and vindictive. Scorpio people enjoy impossible tasks. They like work that demands continued, determined effort and intense concentration. They are born detectives.\n",
      "Scorpio gives a strong will and determination to accomplish anything undertaken. Scorpio natives possess an analytical mind, strong intuition, reasoning powers, perception, long range planning ability, magnetism and energy. Scorpio natives have very definite opinions. These opinions can be so rigid that no amount of persuasion will make them change their minds.\n",
      "Scorpio natives make friends easily and give unwaveringly to them. In these relationships, they like to know what your plans are, but, because of their secretiveness, they do not necessarily want you to know what they are planning. They are capable of extreme self-sacrifice for those they love. If any of their loved ones are threatened in any way, they feel that they, too, are being threatened. This causes them to instinctively strike out, either verbally or physically.\n",
      "Because a Scorpio's unconscious mind is more in control than their conscious mind, they lose all sense of judgment under criticism. Under attack, they make effective use of both silence and sarcasm. Unfortunately, their sarcasm can become vindictive. They can, and will, wait a long time in order to get even. Scorpios need to learn forgiveness.\n",
      "It is usually difficult to deceive a Scorpio because their intuition enables them to understand the motives of other people. They receive very strong first impressions of others – experiencing either a liking or a dislike for the person involved.\n",
      "Scorpios need to learn flexibility, both in thought and action. Once their course of action is set, it is difficult for them to change. Trivial things bore Scorpios and they would rather go deep rather than broad. The more intense, the better. In whatever they do, they want to be completely engrossed. Half-hearted measures are not for them.\n",
      "Scorpios have the tendency to do things to extremes, either all or nothing. They have to get to the bottom of whatever it is that interests them. They have to know everything, yet they remain mysterious and secretive. Although it may not appear so, there are powerful emotions and desires at work within a Scorpio underneath the surface. This power is one reason for their great endurance. Sometimes in their battles they trample on others in the process. This is why they are sometimes classified as great saints or great sinners. \n",
      "Scorpios regard themselves as their own judge, jury, and executioner and punish themselves unnecessarily at times. They are self-sufficient, but not necessarily self-assured. They rarely actively seek applause or the limelight. Scorpios are generally healthy, but can be inclined to overindulgence in food, drugs, sex or alcohol.\n",
      "In matters of love, Scorpio natives are loyal, affectionate and demonstrative, and perhaps possessive and controlling. They are happiest and most fulfilled with one partner with whom they can combine emotional and sexual love.\n",
      "None\n",
      "Sun in Sagittarius\n",
      "Sagittarius natives tend to be idealistic, optimistic, dependable, open-minded, friendly, honest and versatile. But, they can also be tactless, irresponsible, showy, boastful, self-righteous, arrogant, quarrelsome, fanatical, dogmatic and dictatorial. Sagittarius natives like any work where foresight and a willingness to take a chance is offered, while at the same time, they try to avoid detailed work.\n",
      "Sagittarius natives are usually outspoken, sometimes to the point of bluntness. Simply blurting out their ideas and opinions is due to their never-ending search for truth and wisdom. Others think Sagittarius natives are pretty tactless and the statement that \"truth hurts\" fits their way of thinking. Regardless of their undiplomatic remarks, others instinctively feel as if the Sagittarian means them no real harm and is only interested in raising their consciousness.\n",
      "Sagittarius natives love the outdoors, large animals, nature and sports. Some have reckless gambling tendencies and will bet it all on the drop of a hat. Travel and even long walks appeal to them because they make the Sagittarian feel free – and he needs to feel free.\n",
      "Sagittarius natives are philosophical and they want to understand the deeper issues and abstractions of life. They have a certain faith in higher things that generally always keeps them of an optimistic bent, no matter what difficulties are currently besetting them. They want to understand the meaning of life. This helps to keep them growing and expanding, which is something they need to do. This desire for expansion can cause them to overextend themselves with too many activities and to use up their energy too rapidly. They need to take intervals of rest to recuperate between projects.\n",
      "Sagittarius natives need to learn how to concentrate on their current projects and stick with them to the end. Always full of enthusiasm, they tend to show it more at the start of new endeavors, then it tends to lessen as the project goes along and gets stuck in details, or the going gets a little rough, or it simply gets a little boring. \n",
      "Although Sagittarius natives are ordinarily healthy, they can run into trouble due to overindulgence in food and drink. \n",
      "Sagittarius natives are known for their friendliness, helpfulness and subtle humor. They are good conversationalists and enjoy debating merely for the sake of debating. They have a real gift for making friends and the typical Sagittarian can go anywhere in the world without ever feeling lonely, for they acquire friends along the route. They have humanitarian instincts and are practical in expressing them. They will tend to help anyone who is in need. You can usually depend on their loyalty and honesty, for there is nothing devious or manipulative in their nature.\n",
      "Sagittarius natives are extremely independent and restless, with a real need for personal freedom. They can experience claustrophobia, either physical or emotional. This is why they are reluctant to get into total commitment situations and often shy away from marriage. In love, Sagittarius natives are highly romantic, but they need their partner to be intelligent and communicative. They hate jealousy and possessiveness on the part of their partner, especially since they are fond of flirting. They enjoy the chase more than the capture.\n",
      "Career wise, Sagittarius natives are reluctant to become tied down to a set schedule, so will experiment with a variety of jobs. They do best in careers that permit them to travel about, either locally or widely. They also like dealing directly with people, either selling or promoting ideas, products, etc.\n",
      "The Sagittarian may overlook small details, but their overall sense of planning is excellent. They have good memories. The challenge of a problem is what interests them, for it caters to their enjoyment in exploring the unknown. Playing games comes easily to a Sagittarian and it is the journey they enjoy rather than the destination.\n",

      "Sun in Capricorn\n",
      "Capricorn natives have the desire to climb whatever mountains are necessary and to stand on their own two feet in order to work out their ambitions and their salvation. They are conservative, organized, methodical, traditional, responsible, honest, efficient, patient, practical, authoritative, disciplined, serious and goal-oriented. On the negative side they can be worried, pessimistic, retaliatory, suspicious, stubborn and intolerant. They are happiest in careers calling for organizing ability, integrity and perseverance. They have a fear of failure.\n",
      "Their quiet exterior makes Capricorn natives appear to be loners. They build a wall of reserve around them in order to protect themselves from the ill winds of the world around them. Nothing gets in the way of their plans and ambitions. They strive for security by holding fast to duty and responsibility. Work is very important to them and they do not take it lightly. Many Capricorn natives have an inferiority complex and this sometimes is what drives them so hard to succeed. They want to look good in front of the world.\n",
      "Capricorn natives like to plan their every move, weighing all the pros and cons of any issue in advance. They are dependable, particularly in a crisis. When asked, they give sound, practical advice. They are, as a rule, not aggressive people, and only express hostility as a defense when attacked.\n",
      "At times, Capricorn natives can be very sensitive to hurts and feel alone as if no one understands them. A negative Capricorn will seek retribution for wrongs done him. Capricorn natives need people, but they have a tendency to isolate themselves from people due to their reserve and fear of being hurt. They can be very loyal to close friends and people they care about. Respect and recognition is important to them. Encouragement and praise are essential for motivating a Capricorn.\n",
      "A fear of being without material things makes it mandatory that Capricorn natives have a regular income. Their attainments in life are accomplished through steady progress rather than through speculation or get-rich-quick schemes. They have strong self-discipline and nothing turns them from their course if their mind is made up. They will give up many pleasures in order to reach their goals. Hard work invigorates them. Capricorn natives are thrifty and like to collect things. They abhor waste. This includes wasting a lot of talk in idle chatter. Capricorn natives speak when they have something to say.\n",
      "Capricorn natives can be creative but they must at times learn to overcome their own self-doubts and lack of confidence. Pessimism in their own abilities can hold them back. They must learn to believe in themselves and become optimistic. There is no mountain they cannot climb if that is what they desire to do.\n",
      "Capricorn natives have a lot of patience, which is good, because many of their plans meet with delays, setbacks and obstacles. This teaches them obedience, which is thus helping them to strive for spiritual attainment rather than material attainment. For them, work is therapeutic and is probably the best medicine for whatever ails them, except overwork, which they are prone to do. It is difficult for a Capricorn to really relax. They are happiest when busy, even in their spare time.\n",
      "Capricorn natives are thoughtful, self-contained people. Lacking, perhaps, some of the personal magnetism of some of the other zodiac signs, they are nevertheless quite tactful, compassionate and warmhearted. Their own personal sufferings help them identify with the sufferings of others. In love, Capricorn natives are as romantic and emotional as anyone else, but usually they feel inhibited in expressing their emotions. They are cautious in making a total commitment until they know that the traits and lifestyle of the possible partner are compatible with theirs. Once married, they seldom divorce because they feel that any situation can be worked out, if only worked at hard enough.\n",

      "Sun in Aquarius\n",
      "Aquarius natives tend to be friendly, original, intuitive, broadminded, nonconforming, different, independent, freedom-loving, scientific, unusual, and helpful. They can also be impersonal, unpredictable, tactless, rebellious, unconventional, stubborn, rigid, radical, bohemian and eccentric. Aquarius natives like any work which calls for inventiveness and the detached application of special rules or formulas.\n",
      "Aquarius natives seek to share knowledge with others in order to bring about a better life for all. Group activity is their customary mode of operation. Helping others so they can help themselves appeals to an Aquarian.\n",
      "Aquarius natives are friendly, yet detached. They have warmth, yet they seem distant. Although appearing cold or aloof, they are not really indifferent to others. It's just that they are much more concerned with humanity as a whole rather than any one particular individual. Since Aquarius natives generally do not have large, pompous or stuffy egos, they rarely bother to exert themselves to win approval or compliments.\n",
      "Aquarius natives get excited about bringing new ideas and methods into old, traditional environments. They are philosophical, visionary and idealistic. Feelings of friendship drive them to try to improve the lot of everyone they can. Sometimes the people they want to help don't understand these new ways and react negatively toward them. Sometimes Aquarius natives are simply ahead of their time, although sometimes they are just cranks.\n",
      "Aquarius natives have the determination and persistence to get ahead, but sometimes their energy level is relatively low, which causes them to drop projects before they are completed. Their minds are analytical and scientific and they have the ability to think things through to an accurate conclusion. Although they generally have good powers of concentration and are able to assimilate a lot of information, there are times when they are just plain absentminded.\n",
      "Aquarius natives usually get along well with others. They are generally not gossips, nor are they petty. They do not like arguments, unless they feel there is a need to defend a person, an ideal or a principle. Since Aquarius natives are so willing to listen to the new and different, they have little patience with those who refuse to hear new concepts.\n",
      "Sometimes Aquarius natives rebel just for the pleasure of it. They have been known to deliberately do things in an attempt to shock people. Most Aquarius natives prefer not to be bound by schedules and regulations, but can easily adapt to them if they must. But don't expect them to always be on time for things.\n",
      "Aquarius natives dislike people who are possessive of them, since they are generally not possessive of people or things themselves. They give others a lot of personal freedom and they expect the same in return. Since they are not particularly concerned as to what other people think of them, they often do not bother forming opinions about other people's behavior.\n",
      "In love, Aquarius natives want an intellectual companion with whom they can communicate. They can be hesitant about making a total commitment such as marriage, or any other form of partnership, because of their desire for independence. However, when an Aquarian marries, the marriage is usually stable. They are loyal and faithful to their marriage partner, but are not prone to excessive displays of affection, especially in public.\n",

      "Sun in Pisces\n",
      "Pisces natives are sympathetic, compassionate, unassuming, idealistic, intuitive, congenial, adaptable, psychic, emotional, creative, secretive, versatile, imaginative and self-sacrificing. They can also be impressionable, indecisive, self-pitying, hypersensitive and changeable. They need to serve others.\n",
      "Pisces natives are sentimental and romantic in love. At times, they expect too much from others and then feel hurt if the other person doesn't come through for them. They have a strong tendency to place their loved one on a pedestal. This leads to disillusionment when they discover their loved one has faults, too.\n",
      "The symbol for Pisces is two fish going in opposite directions connected by a cord. One fish represents the personality and the other represents the spirit. These two opposing forces operate within a Pisces, causing insecurity and indecisiveness. Handling these forces in a positive manner is very difficult for them. Some will seek to escape these pressures through eating, alcohol, drugs or other excesses. That is what one of the fish represents. The other fish represents the Pisces rising to great heights through self-denial, sacrifice and then ultimate attainment. Pisces natives learn through suffering and they need to learn perseverance.\n",
      "Pisces natives tend to absorb the information and environment around them. Thus it is important that they surround themselves with uplifting people and circumstances. Pisces natives are creative, self-sufficient people whose minds are extremely active, due to their strong imagination, which they can sometimes get carried away with. They sense and feel things that others are not aware of.\n",
      "Pisces natives generally do not possess strong willpower nor do they have a dynamic approach to life. Although they can appear to be very determined on the outside, underneath, inner doubts are brewing. This insecurity causes them to need reassurance from others. One of their greatest needs is to learn to understand their emotional ups and downs. Since they have a tendency to doubt their own conclusions, they need to learn to believe in themselves. \n",
      "Pisces natives are very generous with their time in helping other people. They always feel their best when they are serving others in some capacity. By using their compassion outwardly for others, they will not become as moody and introverted. Since Pisces natives are reluctant to hurt others or to face any sort of confrontation, they can become involved in very difficult emotional situations which they find extremely difficult to break. They have a difficult time saying no sometimes and will stay in bad situations thinking that they can somehow change the other person and then all will be well. Some Pisces natives love to play the martyr, while others need to play the savior. Pisces natives tend to think with their heart rather than their head and can be easily used by others. Many fall for any kind of sob story, much to their own detriment. Their hearts are in the right place, it's just they need to be more realistic and down-to-earth.\n",
      "Pisces natives can be highly secretive, but they make friends rather easily and are quite loyal to them. They do not particularly like verbal or combative fights, but will defend their friends in subtle ways. \n",
      "Pisces natives sometimes lack vitality which often gives people the idea that they are lazy. Well, some are and Pisces natives in general do like to procrastinate. A Pisces needs sufficient time each day to be alone while they regain their fluctuating energies. \n",
      "A Piscean's innate desire to escape from physical living can be used constructively through creativity. Many forms of art, dance and music appeal to them. They instinctively seem to know their own capabilities and limitations. Unfortunately, though, their knowledge of their limitations can create an inferiority complex. Pisces natives enjoy drama and acting because it gives them the opportunity of being someone else. This enables them to temporarily lose their inferiority complex. Because of their hypersensitivity, they can become instantly depressed over little things that are said to them.\n",
      "Pisces natives can appear to be deceitful because of an inborn need to justify their words and actions. If in trouble, they may attempt to rationalize their way out rather than face the consequences of their behavior.\n",
