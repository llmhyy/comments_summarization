       "['Aries sun natives can be inspirational, courageous, enthusiastic, original, independent, impatient, aggressive, headstrong, selfish, self-centered, and impulsive. The Aries person’s energies are directed toward building a new individuality, thus all the Aries’ energies are directed towards themselves and what they want. An Aries likes roles where their leadership abilities are put on display. Aries natives have executive and organizing ability which is mainly directed in starting things. Sustaining projects is not their strength, but initiating projects is. The tendency to \"damn the torpedoes\" and ram full-speed ahead must be controlled. Aries natives are capable of great accomplishments if they learn how to constructively use their abundant energies. Aries natives are naturally enthusiastic and are always ready for activity and competition. They are inspiring to others because of these tendencies. Ideas and creative projects seem to flow from them in a never-ending stream. They are full of energy and never lack courage.',\n",
       " 'Because Aries natives can be pretty self-centered, they must remember that other people may have good ideas and can assume responsibility and leadership roles, too. The natural tendency for an Arian is to stand alone and do everything themselves. But cooperation with others can be very effective in getting things done to the end rather than simply starting things and quitting before completion. Aries natives have a tendency to start a project, then to suddenly lose interest in it if progress is too slow or things have become too complicated. ',\n",
       " \"Aries natives are very straight-forward and are neither subtle nor devious. They say what's on their mind and they pull no punches. They don't hold grudges and although they can get quite angry, they do not hold it in and stew about what bothers them. They blow in and out like some great Midwestern thunderstorm. It may be violent while it lasts, but it is usually over quickly.\",\n",
       " 'Aries natives are prone to headaches due to tension. Aries natives are usually aggressive in relationships and generally take the lead. They go after what interests them and the chase may be more fun for them than the conquest.',\n",
