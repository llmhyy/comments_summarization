You can be downright stubborn at times, especially when it comes to making changes that are emotional in nature or that require emotional adjustment. You seek security and often expect this security to come from materials possessions and resources. Hence, you desire to collect material goods and money. You cling to things from the past or things you are used to in order to find this security. A great deal of affection and closeness is needed by you and this helps to assuage feelings of insecurity. But sometimes you hold onto people much too closely so they feel they can't breathe. You expect loyalty in love and you are very devoted to those you care about.

Mental control should be developed or else indecisiveness and constant changing of your mind will become a way of life for you."], "Moon in Cancer": ["If you have the Moon in Cancer, you very easily respond to the emotional environment in which you are placed. You soak up feelings like a sponge. Perhaps this is why you so easily become moody, irritable and inconstant in thought and feeling. Learning to control your own moods may be very difficult, yet necessary, for you. Your greatest need is to nurture and mother someone or ones. You often appear irrational to others because you can't always explain the reason or source of your feelings. Anyone who lives with you must accept your ups and downs and appreciate your need for times of withdrawal. You are also very sympathetic and understand the unspoken feelings and needs of others. You take slights very personally and though you may forgive a mistake by a friend or loved one, you never forget it. Security is very important to you and you look for it in your home and family life. Your senses and emotions are quite strong and it would be wise for you to listen to your intuitive side as you can be quite psychic. You are very tenacious and you do not give up or let go of things or people easily. Your mother is/was a strong influence for good or ill in your life. You are basically an introvert, but will do whatever it takes to protect and defend your family or loved ones.

"], "Moon in Virgo": ["If you have the Moon in Virgo, you are very sensitive, cautious, and perhaps shy about showing others your feelings. Though you may love and care for someone a great deal, you rarely express those feelings openly and freely. You are perhaps more mental than emotional, at least outwardly. Very often your love for someone will be expressed by trying to help them, doing something tangible to benefit them, or serving them in some way. It may be difficult for you to receive warmth, affection, or appreciation, for you often feel that you don't really deserve it or that \"they don't really mean it\". You can therefore seem rather cool and aloof, much more so than you feel. At times you can be so critical of others that you drive them and their love away. You need to learn how to forgive yourself and others when you or they do not measure up to perfection. This need of yours for perfection can be quite stifling to your own happiness. You tend to be industrious, trustworthy, intuitive, reserved, practical and down-to-earth, especially where emotions are concerned. Intelligence, usefulness and fastidiousness are important themes. You have the ability to analyze people and situations and, then, find the quickest, most efficient method of accomplishing whatever is needed. This may make you an excellent housekeeper, nurse and/or manager. You must, however, watch your tendency to nit-pick or to become overly fussy concerning small details. You like to serve others, but find it difficult to understand the feelings of others. Your greatest need is to learn tolerance and to serve those around you."], "Moon in Libra": ["If you have the Moon in Libra, you are kind, sympathetic, agreeable, optimistic, fair, and very fond of social pleasures.

You have a need for people and relationships. You avoid personal confrontations or any expression of intense, unpleasant behavior or emotion. You strive for peace, harmony, and perfect balance. You feel unsuited for menial physical labor and you hate to get your hands dirty. Your desire to be liked by everyone may cause you to seek peace at any price, thus you can be evasive on issues due to your desire to keep the peace. You can be quite vacillating and indecisive. You are much more at odds with yourself than people would guess by looking at you from the outside. It is sometimes very difficult for you to make up your mind because you see all sides of any issue and you always want to be fair. You must learn to stand up for your principles."], "Moon in Scorpio": ["If you have the Moon in Scorpio, you are secretive and inclined to brood in silence over the wrongs that people have done, either in reality or simply in your own mind. The mental and emotional focus may be on sensual things or on sex or death. You find it difficult to trust people as you are suspicious of their inner thoughts and plans. You open yourself up to very few as you do not find it easy to trust others. Allowing yourself to be vulnerable and to relinquish control in relationships is not easy for you. You love with passion and you hate with passion. Everything is done emotionally, with intensity. You can be very jealous and possessive in your relationships. Perhaps your mother was very controlling. You have a habit of holding on to wrongs that have been done in the past and not forgiving nor forgetting, and to keep such feelings to yourself. Guilt, resentment and vindictiveness need to be overcome. You must learn to let go or your health will suffer. Learn to express your feelings outwardly rather than repressing them within.

In addition, you are adventurous, playful, freedom-loving, and always ready for a good time. You rarely allow difficulties to keep you down, for no matter how bleak the past or present, you always expect a better, brighter future. In fact, you are uncomfortable with your own or other people's problems and emotional pain. You often try to \"cheer up\" or offer philosophical advice to those who are hurting, but unwittingly you avoid or ignore the emotions involved. Friendship means a great deal to you, perhaps even more than love or romance. For you to be happy, your mate must be your best friend and encourage your aspirations and ideals. You also need a great deal of emotional freedom and mobility.

You need to accept that no one is self-sufficient all the time, and to be gentler with your \"childish\" emotional needs and wants. To others, you may appear to be rather hard-nosed and tough, with a business-like attitude toward their personal concerns and feelings. Your feelings and loyalties run deep, but you often do not let people know how much you care. You also need to learn to relax, enjoy yourself, and play sometimes. You are conservative, reliable and ambitious. You have the ability to bring plans to completion. On the negative side, you may be ruthless in your desire for power and success. Selfishness and manipulation are possible. You desire recognition. The emotions are steady, but can be quite cold. "], "Moon in Aquarius": ["If you have the Moon in Aquarius, your emotions tend to be guided by intellect and you can be very detached when it comes to dealing with them. Others may think you cold and aloof because they don't understand the ways in which you deal with your feelings. This position steadies your emotions. You find security in dealing with and working with groups of people, especially in endeavors that benefit the majority. You are inventive, original, and progressive in thought and want to make the world a better place to live in.

You are sensitive, kind and gentle, imaginative, shy, tender-hearted, and have an innate understanding of how other people feel and react to situations. It hurts you if another is hurt. Because of your kindness and non-judgmental attitude, people in trouble, pain or confusion come to you hoping to find answers. It is difficult for them to think that you may be in pain yourself, but even if you are, you will do your best to help them or teach them. You seem to sense that all the pain you have suffered is for a higher purpose, if only to teach others or help show them the way. At times, though, your soft-hearted is taken advantage of and then you feel the need to withdraw, to regain your strength and composure. Music plays an important part in your life and you are instinctively drawn to it. It is as a voice from your spirit's true home. It helps you to express the emotions within that sometimes are so nebulous or vague that they cannot be put into word. You have a very romantic nature and can fall in love with love. Sometimes your feelings and fantasies get so carried away that you become overly emotional or sentimental, much to the dismay of those around you.
